# RateMyClass
RateMyClass is an open source project created at Drexel University for the purpose of allowing students to view a class average test score and difficulty level. User can input score they receive from a class and the score will be stored in a database. All scores for a given class will be averaged to find the average score. Depending on how low or high the average score is, the class will be labeled as difficult or easy
