# RateMyClass
RateMyClass is an open source project created at Drexel University for the purpose of allowing students to view a class average test score and difficulty level. Database is built upon anonymous data crowdsource by Drexel Students through submitting grade they receive from a class in order to view grade of other classes. The webapp will automatically parse through SQL database in order to compute class average, score distribution, sample size and then rank the class as easy, medium or hard. All functionalities are automated, thus allowing instantaneous data update. The webapp is also built on a JavaScript sorting algorithm to sort a list of classes from easiest to hardest for each major, then display it to the client side using chartJS framework. 

## How To Use 
1. Register an account. Account must be registered with a Drexel University's email address. This is for verification purpose so that grade are only inputted from Drexel students, and not from outsiders. Attempt to register with a non-Drexel University email will result in failure. 
2. Create an anonymous username and password. A 4-digit PIN code will be generated and send to your Drexel's email address. From now on, you can log in with these credentials. If you forgot your username or password, click "Forgot My Password" and an email will be send to your Drexel Universit's email address containing your username and password. 
3. Input at least 3 grades (e.g A, B, B+) for 3 classes of which you have taken (e.g CS171, CS172, CS164). After you have done so, you will be redirected to a dashboard. 
4. Functionalities:
  i. Dashboard is where user can see the grade distribution across all colleges within the University (e.g College of Arts and Science, College of Computing and Informatics...etc.) 
  ii. Search
