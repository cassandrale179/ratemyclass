SE 101 Foundations of Software Engineering I 3.0 Credits
Teaches students basic programming concepts within a software engineering process that involves specification, documentation, and testing. Programming coverage includes basic programming concepts such as the declaration and assignment of variables, standard data types, constants, conditional statements, loops, introduction to classes and methods, standard and file input/output, arrays, and strings. Process concepts emphasize good internal documentation practices, specifying functional requirements, defect tracking and analysis, and "black-box" testing.
