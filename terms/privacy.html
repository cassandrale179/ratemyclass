	  <h1> Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>
			This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website. We may, however modify and revise these policy terms from time to time. All such changes will be recorded and notified to our users through our services such as email on the date of effect.
		</p>
		<h3><b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></h3>
		<p>
			We receive and store information you give us when you sign up for our services, which include username, password, and email. The information provide is entirely voluntary, however, if you choose not to provide your information when signing up, you will be unable to use our services. The information we collect is as of follow:
					<li>
						<b>University email address: </b>The reason why we only accept Drexel University's email address is that at the moment, RateMyClass.Org is created only for Drexel University students. All of our class data pertained exclusively to Drexel University's records, and therefore, it is under our user's discretion that data exchange will only be allowed from Drexel University students to prevent non-Drexel personnels from submitting grades that are not from Drexel University. We will also use your email as a means of communication if you forgot your password or username. Other than that, the grade you submitted are NOT associated with your Drexel email or ID. We will not use your Drexel email to send advertisements, marketing communication, or any other type of subscription services. RateMyClass.org is not registed as a for-profit business entity under any legal term, and we do not participte in any contract with third parties to sell or publish your PII in any personally identifiable way.
					</li>
		</p>
		<p>
					<li>
						<b>Username and password: </b> You will have the ability to create an anonymous username of your choice upon signing up for an account at RateMyClass.org as well as a password. All subsequent data exchange between users and RateMyClass will be exclusively through your anonymous username. The classes of which you have submitted your grade will be linked to your username, however, only the names of the classes are linked to your username, NOT the grade, and this record is PRIVATE and viewable only to the developer at RateMyClass and you, NOT to the public. This is to ensure that a user cannot submit grades multiple time for the same class, and therefore skewed grade distribution data.
					</li>
		</p>
		<p>
					<li>
						<b>Grade: </b> When signing up for an account, you will be asked to provide at minimum three grades in order to view class record. This is to allow the efficient growth of data exchange so that other users in turn will be able to utilize available data to use our service. As stated above, your grade record is NOT viewable by the public. RateMyClass will just use your grade data to compute the class averge and only the class average is available on the public interface, not individual class score. To see an example of how we display information, see <a href="samplepage.html"> SAMPLE PAGE</a>. Since the model of RateMyClass involve allowing students to anonymously submit test scores to the database, we follow the same guidelines as specified under <b>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). </b>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. FERPA requires that a consent for disclosure of education records be signed and dated, specify the records that may be disclosed, state the purpose of the disclosure, and identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made.  34 CFR § 99.30.  As such, oral consent for disclosure of information from education records would not meet FERPA’s consent requirements.
					</li>
		</p>

		<h3><b>INFORMATION USAGE AND MODIFICATION </b></h3>
		<p>
			We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, as well as allow you to utilize our service. RateMyClass will use the grade you provde as data for our algorithm to compute class average, passing rate, rank class as easy or difficult, as well as allow user to sort class based on the average grade. In exchange, you, as the user, will have the ability to access scores submited anonymously from other users in order to view ranking of a class you are interested. We might also collect your subjective opinion on whether a class is easy or hard through a voting poll. This feature is currently in development and if implemented, will allow you, as the user, to rate a class anonymously. The information display on the public vote will only be the tally of the votes from Drexel students, and your username, email, and password will NOT be displayed with the vote in any way.
			<br /><br / />
			You can always access and modify the PII associated with your Account by clicking changing password within your setting. At the moment, there is no feature to change the username yet, however, if you do desire to change your username, you can always send an email to our developer at <a href="#">mnl98x@gmail.com</a>. If you decide that you no longer want to use our services and want all PII records deleted from our database, you can do so by sending us an email as well.
